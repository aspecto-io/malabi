# OpenTelemetry based Javascript Test framework

- ðŸ’»â€ƒ**Developer friendly**: Built for developers, by developers who love distributed applications.

- âœ…â€ƒ**Validate integration**: Access to validate any backend interaction, fast, simple and reliable.

- ðŸ”—â€ƒ**OpenTelemetry based**: Built based on OpenTelemetry to match the characteristics of distributed apps.


## How it works
<img src='assets/diagram.png' alt='How it work diagram'>

There are two main components to Malabi:

1. An OpenTelemetry SDK Distribution - used to collect any activity in the service under test by instrumenting it. **It is stored in the memory of the asserted service**, and exposes and endpoint for the test runner to access & make assertions.

2. An assertion library for OpenTelemetry data - by using `fetchRemoteTests` function you will get access to any span created by the current test, then you will be able to validate the span and the service behavior
```JS
// get spans created in the context of test
const spans = await getMalabiExtract();

// Validating that /users had ran a single select statement and responded with an array.
const sequelizeActivities =  spans.sequelize();
expect(sequelizeActivities.length).toBe(1);
expect(sequelizeActivities.first.dbOperation).toBe("SELECT");
expect(Array.isArray(JSON.parse(sequelizeActivities.first.dbResponse))).toBe(true);
```

## Getting started
### In the microservice you want to test
1. ```npm install --save malabi``` or ```yarn add malabi```
2. Add the following code at the service initialization, for example: in index.js
```
import * as malabi from 'malabi';
malabi.instrument();
malabi.serveMalabiFromHttpApp(18393);

import axios from 'axios';
import express from 'express';
import User from "./db";

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;

const app = express();
app.get('/todo', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const todoItem = await axios('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
        res.json({
            title: todoItem.data.title,
        });
    } catch (e) {
        res.sendStatus(500);
        console.error(e, e);
    }
});
```

## In your test file
```
const SERVICE_UNDER_TEST_PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
import axios from 'axios';
import { fetchRemoteTests, clearRemoteTests } from 'malabi';
const getMalabiExtract = async () => await fetchRemoteTests(18393);

describe('testing service-under-test remotely', () => {
    beforeEach(async () => {
        // We must reset all collected spans between tests to make sure span aren't leaking between tests.
        await clearRemoteTests(18393);
    });

    it('successful /todo request', async () => {
        // call to the service under test - internally it will call another API to fetch the todo items.
        const res = await axios(`http://localhost:${SERVICE_UNDER_TEST_PORT}/todo`);

        // get spans created from the previous call 
        const spans = await getMalabiExtract();
        
        // Validate internal HTTP call
        const todoInteralHTTPCall = spans.outgoing().first;
        expect(todoInteralHTTPCall.httpFullUrl).toBe('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        expect(todoInteralHTTPCall.statusCode).toBe(200);
    });
});
```

## Why should you care about Malabi
Most distributed apps developers choose to have some kind of black box test (API, integration, end to end, UI, you name it ðŸ˜Ž).

Black box test create real network activity which is instrumented by OpenTelemetry (which you should have regardless to Malabi).

Imagine that you can take any existing black box test and validate any backend activity created by it.

#### Common use case
You are running an API call that create an new DB record, then you write dedicated test code to fetch the record created and validate it. 
Now you can rely on Malabi to validate it with no special code `(await getMalabiExtract()).mongodb()`


## Take it for a test ride
You can find an example service and test to show case how it works.

1. In the **project root** run `yarn` to install dependencies, followed by `yarn build`.

2. Start the **service-under-test** by running:
```sh
yarn --cwd examples/service-under-test start
```
3. In a different terminal process, run the tests:
```sh
yarn --cwd examples/tests-runner test:example
```
